# Homework 4 Test Files

In this folder are going to be all the example scenes that you should test your raytracer with. Each scene has two files: a scene file, and a png file showing what the scene should look like when rendered by your raytracer.

| File Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| example1 | This file has a single sphere, centered in the view, lit only by ambient light. |
| example2 | The same sphere as example1, but this time lit by a single point light, with only diffuse shading. |
| example3 | Like example 2, with both diffuse and specular shading. |

I'm going to add more but these will get you started.
