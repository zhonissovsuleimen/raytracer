# Homework 4 Test Files

In this folder are going to be all the example scenes that you should test your raytracer with. Each scene has two files: a scene file, and a png file showing what the scene should look like when rendered by your raytracer.

| File Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| example1 | This file has a single sphere, centered in the view, lit only by ambient light. |
| example2 | The same sphere as example1, but this time lit by a single point light, with only diffuse shading. |
| example3 | Like example 2, with both diffuse and specular shading. |
| example4 | A single triangle with diffuse and specular shading. |
| example5 | A sphere lit by a single directional light, diffuse shading only. |
| example6 | like example 5 but with both diffuse and specular shading. |
| example7 | A sphere with three separate lights, two point lights and one directional light. |
| example9 | A complete sample scene, with several spheres inside a box, and different materials. |
| example10 | OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT: a scene demonstrating shadow rays (five spheres in a box with a single light near the center). |
| example11 | OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT: Similar to the scene in example 9, but with shadows. |
| example12 | OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT: Similar to example 9, but with mirror rays, with some extra spheres visible in the reflection on the "other side of the room". |
